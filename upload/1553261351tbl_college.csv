Therefore zeroing in on the right kind of institution could be a tricky task.</p>

<p>In their college search, students are greatly aided by independent private university rankings in India. It makes their college search process more data based and thereby more accurate. The top ranking universities in India too greatly benefit from college rankings India because the true picture of the strongest institutions emerges clearly and fairly.</p>

The list of private universities in India is bewilderingly long and Sanskriti had started at the bottom of the college ranking pyramid.

<p>A note of caution here is that the private university ranking in India can be misleading and often forged. Therefore, aspiring students should perform due diligence by checking the credentials of the issuer of the private university ranking in India or anywhere else for that matter. Moreover, the list of private colleges in Delhi NCR and across the nation, which have been ranked by a credible issuer, is not very long. Therefore itâ€™s a wise college search strategy to witness the campuses first hand and talk to the alumni.</p>",<p>Library of the University is a treasure house of authentic and valuable information that support the educational and research needs.

 REVA University - Logo","There was a time when survival depended on just the realization of physiological needs. We are indeed privileged to exist in a time when ‘intellectual gratification’ has become indispensable. Information is easily attainable for the soul that is curious enough to go look for it. Technological boons enable information availability anywhere anytime. The difference, however, lies between those who look for information and those who look for knowledge.

It is deemed virtuous to serve seekers of knowledge and as educators it is in the ethos at REVA University to empower every learner who chooses to enter our portals. Driven by our founding philosophy of ‘Knowledge is power’, we believe in building a community of perpetual learners by enabling them to look beyond their abilities and achieve what they assumed impossible.

India has always been beheld as a brewing pot of unbelievable talent, acute intellect and immense potential. All it takes to turn those qualities into power is a spark of opportunity. Being at a University is an exciting and rewarding experience with opportunities to nurture abilities, challenge cognizance and gain competence.

For any University, the structure of excellence lies in the transitional abilities of its faculty and its facility. I’m always in awe of the efforts that our academic board puts in to develop the team of subject matter experts at REVA. My faculty colleagues understand our core vision of empowering our future generation to be ethically, morally and intellectually elite.

Founded in 2011 Graphic Era Hill University is today widely known for its innovative and rigorous education which has nurtured professionals across industries and sectors in India and beyond. Graphic Era Hill University has adopted a global approach to education and research with focus on International perspectives and expertise.

","“Education, in the largest sense, is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual.

In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills and values from one generation to another”. Education, thus, is that fundamental fulcrum which stimulates social evolution.

On the global platform, India has the responsibility of transforming itself into a developed nation with a strong ethical system- this; however is a great challenge, as this can only be achieved through the youth of today who have the power of ideas, ambition, ability and most importantly passion.I believe passionately that we are all born with tremendous capabilities, but unfortunately, we lose these as time goes by and ironically this can be directly attributed to the current system of education which stifles the creative senses rather than enhancing it.

Margaret Mead once said, “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.” I philosophize that an enlightened and socially responsible human being can be molded by a teacher via two unique characteristics- first, by inculcating curiosity and drive among the students to inquire, innovate, create and lead by example. Second, by developing a strong value system and putting the same to practice- the noble life pursued by a teacher indeed becomes a beacon to the students.

We, at Graphic Era Hill University, strive to create an environment where every individual is inspired to grow beyond the realm of the curriculum to achieve personal as well as well professional growth. Our efforts are aimed at identifying human talent & passion and understanding the conditions under which this talent can flourish to the full extent. Graphic Era Hill University is thus about “how we can prepare our students in the best possible way to meet head on all the challenges of the future.

With these words, I would like to welcome all to Graphic Era Hill University and wish them all the success in the world as they embark on this new journey with us.",,,,,,,,,,1,,
